# Oryn Finance

**The First CDP Protocol for Uniswap NFTs**

Oryn Finance enables you to use your Uniswap V3 liquidity position NFTs as collateral to borrow our stablecoin (OrynUSD). Access liquidity from your locked LP positions while still earning trading fees from Uniswap.

## What We Do

**Problem**: Uniswap V3 liquidity positions are represented as NFTs, leaving billions in idle, locked liquidity that can't be directly borrowed against.

**Solution**: Oryn Finance creates NFT-backed Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) that allow you to:
- Use Uniswap LP NFTs as collateral
- Borrow our stablecoin (OrynUSD) 
- Continue earning trading fees from your Uniswap positions
- Access capital efficiency in DeFi

## How It Works

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet
- Connect your wallet to the Oryn Finance platform
- Ensure you have Uniswap V3 liquidity position NFTs in your wallet

### Step 2: Select Your NFT
- Browse your available Uniswap LP NFTs
- Select the NFT you want to use as collateral
- View detailed information about your position:
  - Token pair and fee tier
  - Current value in USD
  - Fees accumulated
  - Liquidation threshold

### Step 3: Deposit Your NFT
- Approve the Oryn contract to transfer your NFT
- Deposit your Uniswap LP NFT as collateral
- Your NFT is now locked in the Oryn protocol

### Step 4: Borrow OrynUSD
- Calculate your maximum borrow power (80% of NFT value)
- Enter the amount of OrynUSD you want to borrow
- Mint OrynUSD tokens to your wallet
- Continue earning fees from your original Uniswap position

### Step 5: Monitor Your Position
- Track your health factor to avoid liquidation
- Monitor your debt and collateral values
- View real-time position metrics

### Step 6: Repay and Withdraw
- Repay your OrynUSD debt to reduce your loan
- When debt reaches zero, redeem your NFT
- Get your original Uniswap position back
